# CO2_Calculator
This repository contains a code that allows to calculate the CO2 captured by a land of trees and check the individual storage capacity of each plant based on _Protocolo para la estimaci√≥n nacional y subnacional de biomasa-carbono en Colombia (MAVDT, IDEAM; 2011)_.
The user can select between introducing the data of the trees manually or using a .txt database with tab separated columns. An example for a database is provided in the _datos_arboles.txt_
